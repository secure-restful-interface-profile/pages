<a name="about-this-project" class="anchor" href="#about-this-project"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About This Project</h3>

<p>The profiles and documents on these pages were created by The MITRE Corporation in 2014 for the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  VA asked MITRE to design an approach to securing Represtentational State Transfer (RESTful) interfaces by profiling open standards for REST security.  The goal was to create a common profile enabling VA and its partners to share information through RESTful APIs in a secure and interoperable way, using open standards.</p>

<h3><a name="about-the-profiles" class="anchor" href="#about-the-profiles"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About the Profiles</h3>
<p>MITRE created draft profiles of OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect 1.0 along with some explanatory presentations and security guidance.  Profiling is the process of adding to or modifying standards to tailor them for a specific use through changes such as additional requirements, making optional features mandatory, or specifying implementation details left unspecified in the original standard.  MITRE sought to accomplish three things in the profiles for OAuth and OpenID Connect:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guarantee a baseline level of security suitable for VA use cases (many of which involve patient data), while still maintaining the usability and ease of implementation that make REST appealing</li>
<li>Point to advanced security measures that can be used for high-sensitivity use cases, where impacts to usability may be justified by security concerns</li>
<li>Reduce the "optionality" of the standards to guarantee interoperability among VA and its partners</li>
</ul>

<p>The profiles were written to address basic, common aspects of OAuth and OpenID Connect security (such as specifying a format for OAuth access tokens) and intended for use across a wide range of use cases.</p>


<h3><a name="public-release" class="anchor" href="#public-release"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Public Release</h3>

<p>Profiles for information sharing are only useful to the extent that they are adopted among information sharing partners.  For this reason, these profiles have been left in "draft" status and publicly released to enable VA and MITRE to collaborate with other organizations that interact with the VA's systems.</p>

<p>It is also our hope that these profiles may be generally useful for other organizations (within and beyond the health care domain) seeking a standard, interoperable, and secure approach to securing REST interfaces.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p>

<p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p>

<p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://github.com/blog/821" class="user-mention">@mention</a> a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (<a href="https://github.com/defunkt" class="user-mention">@defunkt</a>), PJ Hyett (<a href="https://github.com/pjhyett" class="user-mention">@pjhyett</a>), and Tom Preston-Werner (<a href="https://github.com/mojombo" class="user-mention">@mojombo</a>) founded GitHub.</p>
